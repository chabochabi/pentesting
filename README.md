A collection of tools that help out in certain pentest situations... 

# Tools

## pp - /etc/passwd parser

You know sometimes when /etc/passwd is "too big" and the formatting is all messed up because of some missing newline characters? This tool just parses the contents and returns prettu prints it, including a list of "human" users.

## findurl

I use this tool to extract all URLs (ftp://, http:// https://, memcache://, gopher://) from a given website.
